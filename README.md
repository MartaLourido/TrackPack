## TrackPack 

![logo](src/assets/images/logo3.jpg)

An application used to filter packages from an API based on user preference, built with React, Hooks, JavaScript, and CSS.

## Project Information

In this project, users can search for their packages by id in a navigation bar and can also filter them with different filters. 
They can also see a map with the location of the package for a clearer detail of where to find it and when it will arrive with all the information extracted from the API.
The project is made to be responsive.
